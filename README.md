# tufte-pandoc-jekyll

Welcome to your new Jekyll theme! In this directory, you'll find the files you
need to be able to package up your theme into a gem. Put your layouts in
`_layouts`, your includes in `_includes` and your sass in `_sass`. To experiment
with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“
this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "tufte-pandoc-jekyll"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: tufte-pandoc-jekyll
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tufte-pandoc-jekyll
